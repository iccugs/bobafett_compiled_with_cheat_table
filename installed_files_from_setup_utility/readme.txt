Directions:
In case you've never used a trainer before heres how you do it:
1: Start diablo and then press alt + tab at the same time and you will switch back to windows
2: Run my trainer, the trainer will show a list of players in the game (if you're in a game)
   and then you can select a character and save/restore/ or edit it.
3: Hacks are like cheat codes I guess. You can load hacks from dat files and select which
   ones you want to apply and activate them.  Be careful of using the 2nd crash hack.  This
   should only be activated after you've selected your character.  If this is activated
   when used in conjunction with the 'No CD' hack, then it won't work.
4**If you restore your character when you tab back into diablo you should always re-equip
   something on your character before you walk or it will close diablo!  By re-equip, I mean
   pick up something in your INV and place it back down before you move.

Write a message to Great_BoBaFeTT@hotmail.com if you have questions about
a problem you're having or if you have a suggestion.  I will not reply
if you ask a question about something that has the answer in any of
the .txt files that comes with the trainer.  custom.dat has additional
information about how to set up those.  Just open it in a text editor
like wordpad or notepad.

History of changes made to the trainer:
17 June 2001 VERSION 6.8:
This version of the BoBaFeTT trainer works with Diablo 1.09!  The hacks have not yet
been added.  You can load and save .dat files that you have already so you don't have
to use another .dat file program.
This version has all of the other functions available such as item
import and export as well as save and restore from .cha files.  The hacks and
special hacks will be added to the next version of the BoBaFeTT trainer.

VERSION 6.7:
All hacks have been added to this version of the trainer.

17 June 2000 VERSION 6.5:
This version of the BoBaFeTT trainer works with Diablo 1.08!  A few of the hacks
have been made to work with this new patch of Diablo.  The next version
will have the other hacks added.

30 January 2000  VERSION 6.0:
This version has a complete setup program for you to use to make it easier
for installation and use of the trainer.

24 June 1999 VERSION 5.6:
Finally got around to adding a couple more codes to this release.
Also fixed up all the links to point to the new domain web page.

27 March 1999 VERSION 5.5:
Added several hacks to the selectable hacks listing.  Added 'Remove'
and 'Remove All' options to the menu bar.

26 March 1999 VERSION 5.4:
Improved on a bug in the trainer and also improved on performance.

25 March 1999 VERSION 5.3:
The hacks listing has been greatly improved.  Included is the ability
to add additional hacks by loading a .dat file.  If the additional hacks
conflict with the built in ones, the .dat file can still be loaded, but
you have to keep in mind that you will need to deactivate the hacks that
share locations or they will become as an error.  You can remove
individual or all of the built in hacks and load your own .dat file or
one that was picked up from somewhere else.  The special hacks has
been fixed to work with Hellfire.

22 March 1999 VERSION 5.2:
Got the character spoofer (Change your name before you enter a game)
hack put into the trainer.  It's in the "Special Functions/More Hacks"
section.  Check the box and change the name, class or level of the
person you want to become before you join or create a game and you
will be that when you enter.  Fixed the God mode from monsters hack
so that if you hit a monster on a level, the lightning spell won't
hurt you on levels 13 and 14.  Added an "Activate all" and "Deactivate all"
button to the listing of hacks that are selectable.  Also added
a new prevent crash from Cyber Smoke's 2nd crash.

21 March 1999 VERSION 5.1:
Finished this version later today.  This has the "Special" hacks section
working now.  You enter the values as they're accepted.  If you want to
turn them off, you simply uncheck the box and click OK.

21 March 1999 VERSION 5.0:
This version has added a few more patches for the different forms of crashing
a game.  Now no one should be able to crash your game.  If you find out some
one can, tell me how they did it by writing to me at Great_BoBaFeTT@hotmail.com
Do NOT have a folder named "Diablo" or "Hellfire" or the trainer won't be able to open
the Diablo program to apply patches or load and save character data.
The selectable hacks listing is new in this release.  When the trainer is
started initially, the list will default to all "On" when the list is opened.
If you select "OK", all of the hacks in the list will be activated.  The "Special"
hacks will be placed into the next release.  These are hacks that are changeable
by a name or value such as "Entering a game with any name you want" and
"Default the initial spell".  The "Special" hacks require input from you before
they are activated.

1 November 1998 VERSION 4.7:
Added all the hacks for Hellfire that work with Diablo now.  Both
the BoBaFeTT editor and the "Don't lose life when touch fire (burning cross)"
hack have been added for Hellfire.  Also improved on the performance
of the trainer.  Also added almost all my Hellfire hacks in BoBaHell.hak
to the BoBaMiNi.zip so you can use them with GameHack and the BoBaFeTT mini
trainer if you don't want to use the full version.

17 October 1998 VERSION 4.6:
Fixed the permanent name change so that it works with all versions of
Diablo including Shareware, 1.00, 1.05 and 1.07.  Fixed up the info
text screen to better give proper credit to those that have assisted.

10 October 1998 VERSION 4.5:
Added Town Kill for Diablo 1.07 - no one else has this from what I have
seen so far up to today.  This does not hurt others that don't activate
it and the reason I added this was because so many were asking for it.

8 October 1998  VERSION 4.4:
Created a few more hacks for Diablo 1.07 in the custom.dat file.
Added don't lose life when touch fire (burning cross) in the built in
hacks list.  Changed the notice of which version of Diablo you're using
so that it appears in the main display.  Fixed the prevent 3rd item
crash so that it has sound now when an item is placed back into the INV.

5 October 1998  VERSION 4.3:
Added all forms of patches for anti item crashes in the game.  Added
the BoBaFeTT editor.

3 October 1998  VERSION 4.2:
Fixed a lot of things in the character stats dialog.  Got the drop down
list for both the character class change and the spells listing done.
Fixed up the permanent name change and the blank name option boxes.
Arranged the character dialog items around a little.  Added all forms
of Auto Kill in the built in cheats section.

28 September 1998  VERSION 4.0:
I've decided to go with full version releases now.  Mainly because of the
improved item editor function and also because this new version has been
completely re-done from scratch so that it contains no code from any other
trainers.  The idea for the BoBaFeTT trainer originated from Enigma's
trainer, but now all code is completely mine and it took quite a while
to do.  The real Enigma is no longer using Diablo and has moved onto other
games.  I send a thank you to him where ever he is for with his
release of his source, he has helped quite a number of Diablo players.

25 September 1998  VERSION B3B5:
Updated the text to reflect my new web page at http://members.xoom.com/LordBoBaFeTT
Also fixed a bug in the help and in the item editor.

23 September 1998  VERSION B3B4:
Works with Diablo 1.07!!  

16 September 1998  VERSION B3B3:
Fixed the Profile Crash patch so that it will work properly in Windows 95.  Previously,
it was only working in Windows 98 and NT.  Now there is a separate button for
Windows 95 users.

12 September 1998  VERSION B3B2:
Improved the Profile Crash Patch so that it works with Windows 95 and Windows 98
and still works in Windows NT.

12 September 1998  VERSION B3B1:
It looks as though the Item Import and Export is working fine except
for a few small caveats.  These are the known issues with it:
1) It doesn't display the item imported in the list.
It's there in memory and when you save, it will work, but it just
won't display it.
2) The list displays all items including ones that have been removed
from your INV.  I'm hunting for the location that tells if the item
is active or not.  It must be there somewhere in the player's data space.
3) Last belt item always doesn't show up for some reason.  I have to
look into this.
4) When you're connected to battle.net, you may sometimes be able to
access your character items but it won't really save it because you're
not in a game.  I used to know where the location was that determined
if you're in a game in a prior version of Diablo.  I have to find it for
the latest version in order to know if you're in a game or not and then
it won't go into allowing the user to get to the items when it's of no
use.
Export seems to work beautifully.  Also, when you
double click on the item, you're given the option of exporting that
item.  I did this so that I could quickly save ears and run my
ears_htm32.exe to update the web page quickly when I killed someone.  hehe.

10 September 1998  VERSION B2B9:
Well, I'm finally getting around to doing the Item Import and
Export.  This is still in beta.  You can view others items they
are wearing, but you can't export or import them yet.  That will
be in the next version to be released in a few more days.

9 September 1998  VERSION B2B8:
Fixed a problem in the Anti Profile Crash.

8 September 1998  VERSION B2B7:
Added protection from the Profile Crash.  Also added a separate button
for the Town Kill.  The Profile Crash currently works by a person editing
their GOLD stat right when they get to the Login screen for battle.net.
Most of them have placed in about 80 7's in there.  What this does is
causes an area of ram that is normally used for the stack to be over
written.  I had to write two separate Anti Profile Crash routines because
NT's stack and 95/98's is different.  It works, but when I have the time,
I'll look into having just one code for both.  My code simply places
the correct values into where they should be no matter what has been
over written previously.  I do this at the right time so that things
are set up properly when the code is executed.  The crash actually happened
because the stack not only contains temporary variables, but also contains
return addresses from assembly language CALL statements.  At one point,
we reach a RET statement expecting to return and there happens to be 7777
there.  So we make it to 37373737 (Hex for 7777) which you see when you
crash with this method and the person has used that number.  If they use
any other number or add more values, it doesn't matter.  My patch will
still work because the patch places in the right values over top of the
bad ones at the right time.

8 August 1998  Version B2B6:
Added protection to -_Soulburner_-'s second crash method.  Now you're
protected by every known method of crashing a game from another player.
If another method comes up, just let me know and I'll patch it!  I ought
to work for Blizzard with as much help as I'm giving them to players of
Battle.net!

25 July 1998   Version B2B5:
Improved the Anti -_Soulburner_- crash so that changes in the value
are also protected.

25 July 1998   Version B2B4:
Added protection from -_Souburner_-'s crash code.  Hey -_Soulburner_-
next time make your codes more difficult.  That was too easy to crack man.
When you start writing your game software, I'm going to crack every one of
them and give them all to my friends and the Internet!

21 July 1998   Version B2B3:
Added the dialog box for the import and export of items.  Have not completed
the item listing yet but have the foundation there for the list to be done
soon.  Also moved two hacks into the custom.dat file for allowing modification
to those hacks for changing the spells for hot keys and the spell to start when
joining or creating a game.

B2B2:
Fixed the character stats to display some data from the other
player and they are also editable if you select your own
character.  You can't change your name or class yet.  That will
be fixed more than likely in the next version.

B2B1:
Added the display box for changing character stats, but have not activated
it yet.  I'm working on doing that first and then will put in the item import
and export as well as the selectable hacks listing.  Added the "Prevent Game
Crash 2nd method".  This is to prevent you from crashing when someone uses
my editor and uses /c on an item and drops it in the game.  Added buttons for
the other options I plan to put in the trainer.  Auto Load Equipments doesn't work
yet.  Will be in a later version.

Everyone dies. It's the final and only lasting justice. Evil exists; it is intelligence
in the service of entropy. When the side of a mountain slides down to kill a village,
this is not evil, for evil requires intent.
Should a sentinent being cause that landslide, there is evil; and requires Justice
as a consequence, so that civilization can exist.
There is no greater good than Justice; and only if law serves Justice is it good law.
It is said correctly that law exists not for the Just but for the unjust, for the
Just carry the law in their hearts and do not need to call it from afar.
I bow to no one and I give service only for cause.
