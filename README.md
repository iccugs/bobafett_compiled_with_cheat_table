# bobafett_compiled_with_cheat_table
 compiled bobafett trainer with old .dat files (non-working) and cheat engine table (working) for diablo v1.09 battle.net

### the rundown
I was having a hard time finding old hacks for Diablo 1 after finding out that Blizzard is selling the game on battle.net again and multiplayer servers are up for the game. Feeling nostalgic, I went through a bunch of 90's geocities websites and cheat engine forums and this is what I was able to get. Most of this stuff is self explanatory, but the dat files for the old diabhack program don't work (they are for other versions of the game). Feel free to use a program such as Cheat Engine to reverse engineer the old work and create new hacks in the old dat file format. Other than that, these hacks work pretty great. I was able to import items from the ITM files and use Bobafett's trainer to modify my stats. I was even able to use the cheat engine table in online play. Keep in mind that this is an old game that has gone unpatched for years and years, so I would say me mindful of that in online play.
