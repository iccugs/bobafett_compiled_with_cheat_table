# All of these hacks for Hellfire were written by the Great BoBaFeTT except
# those noted by Soulburner.  The last
# three hacks were were taken from another file that should have been
# put in a .hak file.  For some reason, somebody is trying to get
# credit for modifying Diablo Hacking Utility specifically made for HellFire.
# This is stupid because all they had to do was put in the hacks into a
# .hak file to be used with Game Hack which was written by the same person
# that wrote DiabHack.

# Before I begin, I must say that battle.net is the place on this
# planet that I've seen the most liars combined in one location.
# Only believe those who can prove what they're telling, not those
# that just talk crap.  I've seen so many liars on battle.net,
# it's astounding.  I've met players I've killed that won't admit
# it and will lie and say they've killed me.  I've met players
# that make up a phony ear (easy to do with Hacker Diablo Trainer
# and a hex editor on a .itm file).  I've met players that keep
# talking about the cow level when there is no such thing.  I've
# met players that continue to say that Diablo's Plate is really
# a plate and not an ear (hacked).  I've met players who say
# they're not cheating, when they know they are with Diablo
# Hacking Utility or Raymonds Diablo Trainer.  battle.net is a
# place where a lot of players will lie about just anything.
# I'm not saying that I'm a saint, but just be observant and you
# can find which players are telling the lies.  If a player
# cannot prove what he's telling you, then it's more than likely
# a lie.
#
# It's really easy to convert codes from a prior version of Diablo
# to a new version.  Here's how...and anyone with knowledge of Soft-ICE
# can do it!  Other dats will say they've done these codes and
# some were probably really done by them and they say that if you
# see the codes, it was taken from their dat file.  That's
# garbage!  If you know how to use Soft-ICE's search facility
# really well, you can convert the codes to 1.04 yourself!
# All you have to do is find the bytes around the location from
# 1.03 and search for those bytes in 1.04.  It can be tricky
# sometimes, but with patience, all of the codes can be converted
# in about 1 hour!  What the others won't tell you is what I've
# just told you; and that's how to develop your own codes from the
# codes in the previous version.  So when 1.05 comes out (if there
# ever will be another version), then you can use Soft-ICE and
# find the codes in this .dat file by loading in 1.04 of Diablo
# and searching for the bytes before and after the strings in this
# .dat.  Then load in 1.05 (or whatever new version of Diablo is
# next) and search for those strings.  You should only find one
# occurence.  If you find more, you'll have to increase the search
# size by looking for more bytes from 1.04, or write down all of
# the occurences and test out the strings to ensure they work as
# you would have expected.  It's very simple if you know
# Hexadecimal editing.  It requires no assembler knowledge.  Intel
# assembler knowledge is only required if you want to make new
# codes that are not available from a prior .dat file.
# Although they basically do the same thing as the Diablo 1.00
# versions, there is considerable changes in the execution of the
# code.  Blizzard may fix Diablo so that some of the codes are not
# convertible to another release.  You just have to keep that in
# mind when you do your searching.  Of course Diablo II is going to
# be completely different so don't expect any codes from Diablo 1.04
# to be converted to Diablo II.  ...the best thing is to learn
# Intel Assembly language if you really want to be able to hack
# programs or games.  Happy hacking!
#
# When Blizzard makes a new release of Diablo, none of the
# following codes will work and the long ones will
# not be easily transferrable unless the person knows Intel
# Assembly language.

# If you're interested in what it does, it basically changes the instruction
# instead of moving in FFFFFFFF to the location in the players space for the
# inventory, it moves in 00000000.  How does it accomplish this from the code
# below?  Well, if you look at the assembly code of this, you'll see the
# instruction: mov dword ptr [ecx+53ac], ebx at location 420a47.  I change this
# to: and dword ptr [ecx+53ac], 00
# That simply makes the location to 0 instead of FFFFFFFF which is in EBX

# F7 for Teleport and F8 for Fireball.  Bone Spirit=23
